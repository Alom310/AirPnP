# DriveWayz

### What is DriveWayz?
  Think Airbnb but for driveways. DriveWayz is an app to rent peoples driveways to park your car, or owners can rent out their own driveway to make money.

### Motivation
A friend of mine suggested the idea because she lives near Golden Gate Park and sees tons of people looking for parking whenever they have large events in the park. 

### Technologies Used
Python, Flask, WTForms, Peewee, SQLite3, Bootstrap, Custom CSS

### External APIs
- Google Maps API
- Stripe Payment API
